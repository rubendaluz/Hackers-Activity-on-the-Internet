# Hackers-Activity-on-the-Internet
This research aims to analyze the activities of
 hackers on the internet and assess the effectiveness of
 using honeypots in the AWS cloud as a proactive security
 measure, attracting hackers and gathering valuable data
 about their activities. By deploying and configuring two
 low-in honeypots in different regions in the AWS cloud,
 it becomes possible to monitor and analyze the behavior
 of hackers, identify attack patterns, and develop more
 effective security solutions. This study aims to contribute
 to the understanding of hackers activity and enhance the
 protection of systems and networks against cyber threats.
